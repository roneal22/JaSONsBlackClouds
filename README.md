Part 1:  Create a JSON
Your assignment is to create a JSON to represent a set list for a cover band.  Each entry should 
have space to describe the artist(s), title, music genre(s), and year the song was released.
Note:  The JSON object you create should allow each song to have multiple genre's 
You must include at least 10 songs. The data must be real.  You may reuse the data from the XML 
assignment.  You must have songs from at least 3 genres (genre could be country, rock, pop, 
metal, ska, etc)
The JSON must be in its own file.

Part 2: Serialize and display
Display all data on page (serialized) as a raw string

Part 3: User friendly display 
Display all data in a user-friendly format in a table or something similar to this: 
Who Loves You
Artist: The Four Seasons
Genre: rock, disco
Released 1975

Part 4: Filter the data
Create a form that allows the user to pick a genre.  The form should have a drop down box 
(<select>) listing the possible genres plus a button labeled "Filter".  You must provide a choice of 
only the genres that are in the set list.  
When the user clicks the button, display only song titles from the selected genre in a user friendly 
format.
  
Note:  All items MUST be displayed on the page - not in an "alert"
